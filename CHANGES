 * Added sample_rate and buffer_size methods to Audio::LADSPA::Network
 * Audio::LADSPA will now only load the first version of any given
   library it finds in $ENV{LADSPA_PATH}. (this used to throw a 
   pretty useless exception).
 * Upgraded ppport.h to the version shipped with perl 5.8.8

0.016 -
