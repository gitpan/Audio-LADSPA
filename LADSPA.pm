=head1 NAME

Audio::LADSPA - Modular audio processing using LADSPA plugins. Implements a LADSPA 1.1 host.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Audio::LADSPA;

    for my $class (Audio::LADSPA->plugins) {
	print "\t",$class->name," (",$class->id,"/",$class->label,")";
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

LADSPA plugins are objects in shared libraries that can generate or transform audio
signals (like VST or Direct-X plugins on Mac and Win32 systems). Most of the existing
LADSPA plugins are pretty low-level compared to VST plugins (you get seperate
oscilator, ADSR and delay plugins instead of "complete" virtual synthesizers etc). 
See also http://www.ladspa.org/

With these modules you can create a LADSPA host, which can load the plugins,
query their capabilities, connect them together in a network, and run audio
streams through them.

The LADSPA API was developed for linux but should be platform independent, so you
might be able to compile these modules and the nessisary plugins on win32 systems
(please let me know if it works or not).

=head1 USER GUIDE

This is the reference documentation.  If you want a general 
overview/introduction on this set of modules, take a look at 
L<Audio::LADSPA::UserGuide> (not finished).

Reading L<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin> and L<Audio::LADSPA::Network> is
recommended.

=head1 STARTUP

By default, C<use Audio::LADSPA> will attempt to load all
libraries in the $ENV{LADSPA_PATH} (a colon seperated list
of directories) or "/usr/lib/ladspa" and "/usr/local/lib/ladspa" if
$ENV{LADSPA_PATH} is not set.

You can then get the loaded libraries and their plugins using
the C<libraries>, C<plugins> and C<plugin> methods described below.

=head1 METHODS

All methods in the Audio::LADSPA package are class methods.

=head2 plugins

    my @availabe_plugins = Audio::LADSPA->plugins();

Returns the list of @available_plugins. These are package names
you can use to create a new instance of those plugins, can invoke
class-methods on to query the plugins, and pass to Audio::LADSPA::Network
to do most of the work for you. See also L<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin> and
L<Audio::LADSPA::Network>.

=head2 plugin

    my $plugin = Audio::LADSPA->plugin( %search_arguments );

Get the package name (class) for a specific Audio::LADSPA::Plugin
subclass given the %search_arguments. Returns the I<first matching>
plugin class or C<undef> if none is found. You can use one or
less of each of these:

=head3 id

    my $sine_faaa_class = Audio::LADSPA->plugin( id => 1044 );

Match a plugin class by unique id. If one is loaded returns the class
name. If an C<id> argument is present, other %search_arguments will
not be considered.

=head3 label

    my $delay_5s = Audio::LADSPA->plugin( label => 'delay_5s' );

Match a plugin class by C<label>. If C<name> is also specified,
the plugin must also match C<name>.

=head3 name

    my $noise = Audio::LADSPA->plugin( name => 'White Noise Source' );

Match a plugin class by C<name>. If C<label> is also specified,
the plugin must also match C<label>.

=head2 libraries

    my @loaded_libraries = Audio::LADSPA->libraries();

Returns the list of @loaded_libraries (Audio::LADSPA::Library subclasses),
mostly useful if you want to know which plugins are in a specific library.

See also L<Audio::LADSPA::Library>.
