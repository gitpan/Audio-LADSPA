=head1 NAME

Audio::LADSPA::UserGuide - What you can do with these modules.

=head1 About this document

This document is not finished, and only gives an overview. 
For exact information look at L<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin> and 
L<Audio::LADSPA::Network> and proceed from there.

=head2 What is LADSPA

I<Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API>

From http://www.ladspa.org/

I<Many audio synthesis and recording packages are in use or in development on Linux. 
These work in many different ways. LADSPA provides a standard way for "plugin"
audio processors to be used with a wide range of these packages.>

These modules provide a way to use LADSPA plugins in Perl programs.

=head2 Overview of the LADSPA plugin API

=head3 LADSPA libraries

A LADSPA library contains the code and description for one or more Plugins,
each of which can be completely independent. The library is mostly a
a convenient way of storing multiple plugins in a file.

Basically, the library is just a shared object (.so) file. The Audio::LADSPA
module creates classes for all available libraries. All these classes inherit
from L<Audio::LADSPA::Library|Audio::LADSPA::Library>.

You can find the available LADSPA libraries on your system using

 my @libs = Audio::LADSPA->libraries();

This returns a list of all classnames that represent a LADSPA library.

See also L</Loading libraries>.

=head3 LADSPA Plugins

A plugin is an object that can create audio and control streams, based on
other audio and control streams. In this system, the difference between
audio and control streams is only in their frequency - an audio stream has
a fixed sample rate, a control stream can have a variable sample rate.

I<Figure 1: Plugin layout with input (I) and output (O) ports>

    +- Plugin ----+
    | Description |
    | I Port 1    |
    | O Port 2    |
    | . ...       |
    +-------------+

A plugin consists of a description, a number of ports that can send or
recieve audio or control streams, and methods to connect the streams and
run the plugin etc. See L<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin> for more info.

=head3 The Audio::LADSPA::Buffer

The buffer object implements the audio and control streams. You can connect
multiple ports from different plugins to a buffer, and they will read from it
or write to it, according to their port type. The plugin and buffer objects
do not protect you from making silly (or even dangerous) connections, so take
care when connecting, or use C<Audio::LADSPA::Network>.

I<Figure 2: Example of plugin/buffer connections>

                               +-Plugin 2-+
   +-Plugin 1-+                | O Port 1 +-> Buffer3
   | O Port 1 +--> Buffer1 --> + I Port 2 |
   | O Port 2 +-+              +----------+

                |              +-Plugin 3-+
	        +-> Buffer2 -> + I Port 1 |
                               +----------+

=head3 Audio::LADSPA::Network

The Audio::LADSPA::Network class contains a plugin network; a number of plugins
and buffers that are connected and need to be run in sync. The network can take
care of testing the connections and keeping all plugins running at the same
sample rate. 

=head2 Loading libraries

By default, the statement

    use Audio::LADSPA;

loads all LADSPA libraries it can find from in the paths defined by the evironment 
variable C<$LADSPA_PATH>, if it's defined or from "/usr/lib/ladspa" and 
"/usr/local/lib/ladspa" otherwise.

For each library, it creates a class inheriting from C<Audio::LADSPA::Library>
and then proceeds to create a class inheriting from C<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin>
for each plugin in the library.

After that, you can query the loaded libraries by using:

    my @libs = Audio::LADSPA->libraries();

Which will return the class names of all loaded libraries.

Similary, you can get the list of all loaded plugins with:

    my @plugins = Audio::LADSPA->plugins();

Or, get the plugins from a library:

    my ($lib1,$lib2) = Audio::LADSPA->libraries();
    my @plugins = $lib1->plugins();

Both will return a list of classes (package names) that you can use to
query the capabilities of the plugins, or instantiate new plugin objects that
you can use to process some audio data. 

=head2 Querying plugins

Once your libraries are loaded, you can query the plugins - for instance, you
can ask for the plugin name like:

    my $name = $plugin_class_or_object->name();

Or ask for its input ports like:

    my @ports = grep { $plugin->is_input($_) } $plugin->ports();

See L<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin> for the full story.

=head2 Processing audio data

TODO: This section needs to be written. For now, take a look at L<Audio::LADSPA::Network> and
L<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin>.
