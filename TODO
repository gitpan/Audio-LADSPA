Some ideas that may or may not be implemented...

 . Input & output file streams (possibly using Audio::Data)
 
 . Unify *Plugin::Perl *Plugin::XS and *Network to use the same
   same basic interface and possibly share more code. 
   
   Idea: maybe need something like: Plugin::Static for plugins
   with fixed ports, and Plugin::Dynamic for flexible plugin-like
   object such as networks.
   
 . Move Audio::LADSPA::LibraryLoader code to Audio::LADSPA module
 
 . Clean up interface to library loading
 
 . Clarify docs on library loading
