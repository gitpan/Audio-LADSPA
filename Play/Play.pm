=head1 NAME

Audio::LADSPA::Plugin::Play - Audio::LADSPA glue to Audio::Play

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Audio::LADSPA::Network;
    use Audio::LADSPA::Plugin::Play;

    my $net = Audio::LADSPA::Network->new();
    my $sine = $net->add_plugin( label => 'sine_fcac' );
    my $play = $net->add_plugin('Audio::LADSPA::Plugin::Play');

    $net->connect($sine,'Output',$play,'Input');
    
    $sine->set('Frequency (Hz)' => 440); # set freq
    $sine->set(Amplitude => 1);   # set amp

    for ( 0 .. 100 ) {
        $net->run(100);
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a glue module, acting as a 1-input Audio::LADSPA::Plugin
that sends its input to L<Audio::Play|Audio::Play>. This is currently
the easiest way of getting sound from the Audio::LADSPA modules.

=head1 CAVEATS

Due to
the limitation of Audio::Play, this module is currently mono only, but
it should be reasonably portable. 

All data coming in on its input port is I<immediately> send out to
the sound card when the run() method is called, which probably means
that on slower machines you need run() calls of more samples. On my
machine runs of 100 samples work fine most of the time, but YMMV.

This module is based on Audio::LADSPA::Plugin::Perl, which is unfinished,
so calling certain methods from the Audio::LADSPA::Plugin API on it might
not work. See L<Audio::LADSPA::Plugin::Perl> for details.
